## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap Cards
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned and tried a different method apart from usual column division to put elements in same row using bootstrap classes. This time I used flexbox and learned some of its CSS properties that very much helped me to create a better responsive website. Ordering elements, setting flex size and aligning items gave memuch more flexibity than the previous methods I used to adopt to solve such challenges. I also learned giving a certain color tint to an image using background-color and mix-blend-mode.
